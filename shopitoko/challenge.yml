    ShopiToko is a popular e-commerce platform, it has been experiencing weird activity on their web servers. 
    The company's IT team notices a spike in traffic and some weird access patterns. They suspect that an attacker, 
    known only by the handle "Bargain Hunter," has discovered a vulnerability in their Java-based web application.
    The logs show that Bargain Hunter first probes the server for common endpoints and attempts to fingerprint the application. 
    After some reconnaissance, they launch a series of exploit attempts, eventually succeeding in uploading a suspicious file.
    Using this file, Bargain Hunter attempts to access sensitive customer information, including order histories and payment details.
    They also try to manipulate product prices and create fake discount codes.
    Meanwhile, legitimate users continue to browse products, add items to their carts, and complete purchases on the platform.
    The ShopiToko security team, alerted by the unusual access patterns, begins investigating the incident.
