there are three types of locations where the file will be placed

no.1 Documents/Data Pribadi  where the encrypted files are placed
no.2 the encryptor will be placed in Desktop/Coding Projects/projecta.py
no.3 a screenshot was backed up and it is placed in the onedrive/screenshots folder


Questions:

## the first question is :
What bank was the suspect trying to rob? (bank_nama_bank):

    **the answer is bank_durian_mangga_dua**
    
     this can be found in the screenshot that is backed up on one drive


## the second question is :
The full name of the partner he was working with? (the_name_here): 

    **the answer is rama_pratama_satria**

    this is also found in the screenshot, we can tell because the suspect is talking with him


## the third question is  :
What suspicious file was used to encrypt the files? (file.extension):

    **the answer is projecta.py**

    this can be found at the coding project folder at desktop if you analyze the code you can see that it is an encryptor



## the fourth question is : 
Full name of the main suspect that owns the computer we are investigating? (the_name_here):

    **the answer is adi_wirawan_putra**

    after decrypting the files in the data pribadi folder you will get 2 files a txt file and an image file
    if you click the image file it will show you a picture of the main suspects KTP and thus you have the full name



## the fifth question is :
The secret code (00000): 
    
    **the answer is 88432**

    you get the code by decoding whats in the txt file after careful reading you will come across the code.
